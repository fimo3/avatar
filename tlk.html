        <h2>Premiere</h2>
            <p>
                The Legend of Korra is an American TV show, being a direct sequel to "Avatar: The Last Airbender". 
                It aired on Nickelodeon from April 14, 2012 until December 19, 2014.

        <h2>Seasons</h2>
            <p>
                The show consists of 4 seasons, also called books, just like in "Avatar: The Last Airbender".
                In "The Legend of Korra," each book introduces a unique main villain and explores distinct themes,
                 contributing to the narrative of the series. The structure of the show is designed to challenge the protagonist,
                  Korra, in different ways, reflecting the complexities of her role as the Avatar in a rapidly changing world.
                  The structure of "The Legend of Korra" allows each book to function as a self-contained story with its own conflicts 
                  and resolutions, while also contributing to Korra's overall character development and the broader narrative of maintaining 
                  balance in a world that is constantly evolving. The series emphasizes Korra's growth as she faces and overcomes diverse adversaries, 
                  each representing different ideological challenges and threats to peace and harmony.

        <h2>Summary of the books</h2>
            <h3>Book One: Air</h3>
                <p>
                    The first book follows Korra, the new Avatar after Aang, as she moves to Republic City to learn airbending from Tenzin, 
                    Aang's son. The central conflict revolves around Amon, the leader of the Equalists, who seeks to rid the world of bending. 
                    Amon’s ability to remove bending powers poses a significant threat. Korra, along with her friends Mako, Bolin, and Asami, 
                    works to stop Amon and his revolution. Throughout the season, Korra also deals with her struggles in mastering airbending 
                    and understanding her spiritual side.
                </p>
            <h3>Book Two: Spirits</h3>    
                <p>
                    In Book Two, Korra delves deeper into the spiritual aspects of being the Avatar. The primary conflict arises between the 
                    physical world and the Spirit World. Korra learns about the origins of the first Avatar, Wan, and the battle between the 
                    spirits of light and dark, Raava and Vaatu. Unalaq, Korra’s uncle, manipulates her into freeing Vaatu, leading to a 
                    climactic battle during Harmonic Convergence. Korra ultimately defeats Vaatu but leaves the portals between the two 
                    worlds open, thus merging them and changing the relationship between humans and spirits.
                </p>   
            <h3>Book Three: Change</h3>  
                <p>
                    Following the events of Harmonic Convergence, new airbenders emerge worldwide. Korra and her friends travel to find 
                    and train these new airbenders, seeking to rebuild the Air Nation. The main antagonists are the Red Lotus, a group 
                    of anarchists led by Zaheer, who aim to overthrow world governments and the Avatar. Zaheer gains airbending abilities 
                    and becomes a formidable opponent. The season concludes with Korra being poisoned in an attempt to force her into 
                    the Avatar State so she can be killed, which would end the Avatar cycle. Korra survives but is left physically and 
                    emotionally weakened.
                </p>
            <h3>Book Four: Balance</h3>   
                <p>
                    Book Four is set three years after the events of Book Three. Korra is recovering from her injuries and trauma. The 
                    central conflict arises from Kuvira, who seeks to unite the Earth Kingdom by force, establishing an authoritarian regime. 
                    Kuvira’s ambition leads to the creation of a powerful superweapon, prompting a final confrontation with Korra and her allies. 
                    Korra’s journey in this season focuses on regaining her strength, both physically and spiritually, and ultimately she 
                    embraces a more balanced and compassionate approach to being the Avatar. The series ends with Korra and Asami venturing 
                    into the Spirit World together, confirming their romantic relationship.
