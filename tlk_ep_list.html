                <div class="episodeDescription">
                    Team Avatar reminisces about the past several years, thinking back on themselves and their friends. At the Sato estate, Mako recounts his past to Prince Wu, including how he and Korra first met and his complex relationships with both the Avatar and Asami. At Air Temple Island, Korra tells Asami how she was doubting herself and her position as bringer of balance. She felt as though the world no longer needed her as each of her enemies had thrown it out of balance despite her best efforts to maintain order. Asami is aided in her efforts to cheer Korra up by Tenzin, who tells her that the importance of facing never ending conflicts is to learn and grow from them, noting that Korra had done that. Meanwhile, Varrick relays Bolin's story to the Earth Empire fugitives as a mover-scenario in which Nuktuk plays Bolin, who defeated all of Korra's main enemies working together.

                    Ryu guides a group of tourists through Republic City's Spirit Wilds, though they are soon captured by the plants. Jinora, having sensed the shift in energy, comes to their help with Korra and Opal. Although they fail to track them down, Korra learns that Kuvira is harvesting vines in the Foggy Swamp. She and Opal leave to inform President Raiko about the situation, while Jinora continues her search. At City Hall, the world leaders debate about the best course of action to take against Kuvira, though their meeting is interrupted by Korra and Opal and later Varrick and Bolin. Together, they alert the leaders about Kuvira's plans and it is decided to strengthen the United Republic's borders. While Team Avatar reunites, Opal and Lin plan to leave the city to rescue their family in Zaofu by themselves. Meanwhile, Jinora warns Korra that she has been taken captive by the spirit vines. In order to save her, Korra and Mako enter the Spirit Wilds, though finding her path to the Spirit World blocked by Zaheer, Korra decides to confront him. Since Kuvira's usurpation of power is not what he had intended for the world, the airbender helps her come to terms with the fate that had befallen her and guides her into the Spirit World, where she successfully reconnects with Raava and rescues the souls of Jinora, Ryu, and the captured tourists. Meanwhile, Asami and Varrick are tasked to work together to find a defense against Kuvira's super weapon and Bolin tries to reconcile with Opal. He ends up joining her and Lin on their secret rescue mission to rescue Suyin and her family.

                    Opal, Bolin, and Lin travel to Zaofu, where they run into Toph, who tells them the prisoners have been moved out of the city. Bolin knows where they are and they free them. Zhu Li and Baatar Jr. have been working on a cannon to harness the spirit energy, but Zhu Li tries to sabotage the project. When Kuvira shows up, Zhu Li sabotages the weapon, hoping it would blow up the cannon, though is discovered before her plan is completed. Bolin and Opal save her while the rest of the Beifongs fight Kuvira's army. Meanwhile, in Republic City, Raiko is less than pleased with Varrick's reluctance to use spirit vines as weapons. Korra opts to ask the spirits to help defend the city against Kuvira, but they refuse, saying that they do not want to get involved in human wars.

                <div class="episodeDescription">
                    Kuvira announces to her followers the plan to reclaim the United Republic of Nations, telling them it rightfully belongs to the Earth Empire, and after that, she talks with Baatar Jr. about their wedding and love. Bolin, the Beifongs, and Zhu Li reach Republic City, where the latter alerts Team Avatar and President Raiko of their attack plans; they thus move to prepare the city from Kuvira's attack, evacuating citizens and mobilizing the United Forces. Zhu Li tries to make up with Varrick, but leaves disgusted when he still treats her as an assistant. When Team Avatar goes to ambush Kuvira's spirit energy cannon, they discover it is mounted on a giant mecha suit controlled by Kuvira and barely escape attack. Team Avatar races back to tell Republic City of the imminent threat, but Kuvira arrives mere hours later. After seeing Kuvira show how powerful her weapon can be, Raiko surrenders. As Baatar Jr. is on the way to discuss the terms of the surrender, Korra and Tenzin's family kidnap him in order to get him to reveal how to defeat her superweapon. After Korra and Suyin unsuccessfully try to convince him, Korra threatens to never let him see Kuvira again, which causes him to break. Baatar Jr. radios Kuvira and asks her to back away from the United Republic. She appears to oblige over the radio, but actually tracks the signal and promptly fires her cannon at Team Avatar's location, destroying the facility.

                    Team Avatar narrowly escapes from the destroyed Future Industries factory and devises a plan to take down Kuvira's giant mecha suit. The benders try to slow the suit down, but they are unable to overcome its sheer power. Varrick tries to use an electromagnetic pulse to disable the giant mecha, but is unable to do so, only taking out one battalion of smaller mecha suits. Hiroshi Sato is temporarily released from prison to aid Asami, Varrick, and Zhu Li in engineering the hummingbird suits for use in combat. During this time, Hiroshi and Asami bury the hatchet, and Varrick successfully proposes to Zhu Li. Baatar Jr. reveals a way to disable the giant mecha and the team comes up with a plan to infiltrate the suit. Using a powerful saw rigged to the hummingbird suit, Hiroshi and Asami successfully cut a hole in Kuvira's mecha suit, allowing Korra, Mako, Bolin, Lin, and Suyin to enter; Hiroshi, however, is killed in the process.

                <div class="episodeDescription">
                Korra, Mako, Bolin, Lin, and Suyin have infiltrated the giant mecha suit to destroy it from the inside and split up, with Korra deciding to take on Kuvira directly, Mako and Bolin targeting the weapon's core, and the Beifongs going to disable the cannon. Lin and Suyin destroy the cannon's loading mechanism, rendering it useless. Kuvira rips off the arm with the spirit cannon with Suyin and Lin still inside and tosses it into the Spirit Wilds. Korra subsequently enters the mecha's cockpit and battles Kuvira, the two evenly matched. Mako and Bolin travel to the spirit vine core, where Mako nearly sacrifices himself to take out the core with lightning, but Bolin manages to save him. With the core unstable, the mecha suit explodes, blasting the cockpit into the Spirit Wilds. Upon leaving the wreckage, Korra tries to force Kuvira to surrender, but Kuvira manages to flee. Korra gives chase, where she finds Kuvira aiming the loose spirit energy cannon at her. Kuvira fires at Korra, but loses control of it, is unable to shut it off, and is flung off. The cannon nearly blasts her before Korra puts herself in the middle and energybends the beam around the two of them. This massive amount of spirit energy tears open a new spirit portal, warping Korra and Kuvira to the Spirit World, where Korra speaks with Kuvira and manages to emotionally relate with her, convincing her to stop the battle. Upon exiting, Kuvira tells her army to step down as she is taken away in handcuffs by Lin and Suyin. Korra shares a group hug with Bolin, Mako, the airbenders, Varrick, and Zhu Li as spirits return to Republic City. Sometime afterward, Varrick and Zhu Li get married at Air Temple Island with Bolin presiding. At the reception, Wu reveals his plan to abolish the monarchy to Korra and Mako. Korra and Mako reaffirm their friendship. Away from the dance floor, Korra and Tenzin talk at length about her growth before Tenzin runs away after Asami mentions that Varrick wishes to borrow a glider suit. Sitting with Asami, Korra apologizes for her long absence while Asami says that she is just happy to see her alive and cares deeply for Korra. Asami mentions she needs a vacation and suggests the Spirit World as a destination. Korra and Asami walk alone to the newly created spirit portal, holding hands as they cross over into the Spirit World.
